<h3>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</h3>

<h4>Gaming Company “The Gaming Room” operates an android OS application interface, called “Draw It or Lose It”. In order to effectively target a broader base of users/devices, they have decided to develop a web-based version of the application. </h4>

<h3>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</h3>

<h4>I felt that I was able to really dive into each OS platform and determine its unique characteristics in accordence with the requirements of the application. </h4>

<h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>

<h4>I found every step in constructing a design document very benificial. It allowed for one to really take an indepth look at how and what the code will be interacting with in the system. </h4>

<h3>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h3>

<h4>Personally, I would choose the Domain Model Discription for revision. I would be way more specific and have more detail about the workings of the program in relation to each class./h4>

<h3>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h3>

<h4>The "Game Room" required a website-based gaming interface w/ the abiliy to have multiple game instances operating concurrently and distibuted via networked connection. Considering the clients needs basicly lays out a general set of guidelines to develope from. Without giving the client what they want could result in not producing a product that the client requires or could envolve an abundence of client requested changes due to not incorporating their "needs" before hand.</h4>

<h3>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</h3>
