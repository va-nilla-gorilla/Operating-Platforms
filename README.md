<h1>The Game Room Software Design Document</h1>

<h3>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</h3>

<h4>Gaming Company “The Gaming Room” operates an android OS application interface, called “Draw It or Lose It”. In order to effectively target a broader base of users/devices, they have decided to develop a web-based version of the application.</h4>

<h3>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</h3>

<h4>I felt that I was able to really dive into each OS platform and determine its unique characteristics in accordance with the requirements of the application. </h4>

<h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>

<h4>I found every step in constructing a design document very beneficial. It allowed for one to really take an in-depth look at how and what the code will be interacting with in the system.</h4>

<h3>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h3>

<h4>Personally, I would choose the Domain Model Description for revision. I would be way more specific and have more detail about the workings of the program in relation to each class.</h4>

<h3>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h3>

<h4>The "Game Room" required a website-based gaming interface w/ the ability to have multiple game instances operating concurrently and distributed via networked connection. Considering the clients’ needs basically lays out a general set of guidelines to develop from. Without giving the client what they want could result in not producing a product that the client requires or could involve an abundance of client requested changes due to not incorporating their "needs" beforehand.</h4>

<h3>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</h3>

<h4>Considering that this was an application designed to be distributed over the internet via website, I found researching different cloud-type architectures very beneficial. I personally play the game "Fortnite", which is a hybrid-cloud architecture and dove into exactly how and what Epic games uses for Fortnite operations, which was 100% AWS. After finding that out I jumped onto the AWS website and continued to research, finding all kinds of useful information about cloud application development. In conclusion, the research stage of Research & Development was the most beneficial when moving forward with application development.</h4>
